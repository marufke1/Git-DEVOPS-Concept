****# Git-DEVOPS-Concept:

WHAT IS GIT:** Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes and collaborate on source code projects efficiently. It allows developers to collect, manage, and maintain codebases by recording changes to files over time. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git operates in a decentralized manner, empowering developers to work independently and merge their changes seamlessly. With features such as branching, merging, reset, revert and tagging, Git facilitates streamlined collaboration and enables teams to manage code versions effectively.
